### Outline

This course introduces the basic concepts of text analysis in Python. Participants will learn how to apply text mining methods to text data and analyse it in a pipeline with machine learning and natural language processing algorithms. The course has a strong practical focus, and participants will gain experience in applying text mining to real data.

With the rapid growth of digital textual data in many areas of science, there is a growing need for automated tools that can analyse, classify and interpret this type of data. Text mining techniques can be used to create a structured representation of text, making its content more accessible to researchers. Text mining applications are everywhere: social media, web search, advertising, email, customer service, healthcare, marketing, etc. This course provides an exploration of text mining with Python. The course has a strong practical focus and students will gain experience in applying text mining to real data. Through lectures and labs, students will learn some of the skills needed to design, implement and understand their own text mining pipeline. Topics covered in this course include text pre-processing, text classification and word embedding.

The course covers the following topics:

* Review the basic approaches to text mining
* Understanding and applying current methods for analysing text
* Defining a text mining pipeline given a practical data science problem


### Requirements
Participants should have a basic knowledge of data science and programming and a motivation of scripting in Python.

### Prerequisites
Participants are requested to bring their own laptop for the lab meetings.

### Certificate
Participants will receive their certificate from the office of Utrecht Summer School one week after the course.

# How to prepare

## Column 1

### Preparing your machine for the course

Dear all,

This winter you will attend the course S006: Text Analysis with Python at the Utrecht Summer School in the Netherlands. In order to achieve a steeper learning curve, we will use some features of the Python programming language with Google Colab. The following steps will guide you through the use of Python and the exercises in this course.


<!-- Here you can find some useful information to follow the course online: [this instructional page on MS Teams.](https://www.uu.nl/en/education/quality-and-innovation/remote-teaching/microsoft-teams) -->

<!-- Looking forward to see you all online. -->

_Ayoub Bagheri_

### System requirements

Bring a laptop to the course and make sure you have an internet connection to use Python in Google Colab. If you are using PyCharm or Jupyte Notebook, please also ensure that you have full write and administrative rights to the machine. We will cover programming and compiling in this course. Some corporate laptops come with limited access for their users, so we advise you to bring a personal laptop if you have one.

### Python in Google Colab
Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It is a powerful environment for scientific computing.

We expect that many of you will have some experience with Python; for the rest of you, this section will serve as a quick crash course both on the Python programming language and on the use of Python in Google Colab:

Follow the [tutorial on Python in Google Colab for the Applied Text Mining course from here.](Python_in_Google_Colab_Applied_Text_Mining.html)

This tutorial is mainly from the [CS231n Python Tutorial With Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/blob/master/python-colab.ipynb#scrollTo=dzNng6vCL9eP).

## Column 2

### Alternative approach

I prefer to use Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm when I am not using Google Colab. 

- You can find an extensive tutorial by JetBrains on how to install and use PyCharm from [here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html)

- A beginnerâ€™s tutorial on how to use Jupyter Notebook: [link](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)
